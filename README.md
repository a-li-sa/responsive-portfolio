## Description 

I used Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio with the following items: navbar, responsive layout, and responsive images. 

> Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 

### Minimum Requirements Met for a Responsive Portfolio
